# Chapter 1: Neural Networks

What is a Neural Network? [Please visit this blog post!]()

To implement our first neural network, we will be using 
[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), an open-source python-based
API for developing Neural Networks. Alternative frameworks
exist such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), 
[Keras](https://keras.io/), among others.

This tutorial will provide information in a Jupyter
Notebook format for ease of presentation. 

Topics covered will include:
- loading pytorch bundled datasets

- cuda / non cuda (built-into model)

Dataset:
- loading pytorch data sets
- formatting datasets
- using pytorch dataLoader Class
- using custom classes
- data batching (why batch?)
- data augmentation (Image data)

Single Layer Neural net Model:
- creating a model class
- creating a training class (general for all)
- selection optimizer (SGD, Adam)
- selecting loss criteria (log loss/cross entropy; 
what tasks they are used for)
- setting up training / validation
- training the network

Analyzing results:
- performance metrics
- 

General:
- data normalization

Datasets:
- general
- batching
- shuffling 
- Custom
